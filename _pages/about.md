Hi there! Iâ€™m **Jeanine Ohene-Agyei**, a Master's student in Computer Science at **UC Davis**, where I focus on the intersection of **machine learning** and **systems infrastructure**. I'm particularly interested in optimizing the full ML stack â€” from low-level hardware systems to runtime inference â€” to enable more efficient and scalable deep learning.

Currently, my research centers around:
- **Hardware/software co-design for ML acceleration**
- **LLM distillation and training efficiency**
- **Compiler/runtime-level optimization for GPU compute**

Iâ€™ve submitted a paper to **NeurIPS 2025** on knowledge distillation for large language models, and I previously worked on a **vision science project** involving behavioral coding and computational tools for psychology experiments.

I'm always looking to contribute to impactful research that bridges **systems and AI** â€” especially in GPU programming, ML compiler infra, or training optimization. If our interests align, feel free to reach out!
