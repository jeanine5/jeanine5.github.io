Hi there! Iâ€™m **Jeanine**, a Master's student in Computer Science at **UC Davis**. I am looking forward to conducting my thesis on the intersection of **machine learning** and **systems infrastructure**. I'm particularly interested in optimizing the full ML stack, from low-level hardware systems to runtime inference, to enable more efficient and scalable deep learning.

My broader research interests lie in hardware/software co-design for ML acceleration, training efficiency and compiler/runtime-level optimization for GPU compute, and I am always seeking opportunities to contribute to research and development in these areas.

I graduated from the University of Toronto this past June with an Honors Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Math, with Distinction. During my undergraduate years, I have taken many interesting courses in computer science and math like computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, linear optimzation and many more. I have had the privilege of working closely with and learning from several renowned professors across diverse disciplines. These include [Prof. David Rokeby]([https://www.davidrokeby.com/](http://www.davidrokeby.com/)) (BAFTA winner, machine learning and body motion), [Prof. Caroline Blais]([https://www.ulaval.ca/repertoire-du-personnel/caroline-blais](http://lpvs-uqo.ca/en/directeurs/caroline-blais/)) (UQO, vision and perception psychology), and [Prof. Nandita Vijaykumar]([https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nandita/](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nandita/)) (machine learning and systems).

Outside of school, I enjoy watching movies and anime series! My favorite movie is John Wick (Chapters 1-4) and my favorite anime series is Jujutsu Kaisen.

I'm always looking to contribute to impactful research that bridges **systems and AI**. If our interests align, feel free to reach out!
