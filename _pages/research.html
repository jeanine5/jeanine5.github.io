<h2>Research Focus</h2>
<p>I’m interested in building efficient machine learning infrastructure — particularly at the intersection of <strong>low-level systems</strong> and <strong>model optimization</strong>.</p>

<h3>Core Areas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware/software co-design for ML accelerators</li>
  <li>GPU programming and compiler-level optimization</li>
  <li>LLM distillation and efficient inference</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recent Work</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>NeurIPS 2025 Submission</strong>: Knowledge distillation pipeline for LLM fine-tuning (under review)</li>
  <li><strong>Master’s Thesis</strong>: Exploring systems-level improvements for deep learning workloads</li>
  <li><strong>Vision Science Project</strong>: Original behavioral coding tool for psychological experiments</li>
</ul>
